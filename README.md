# LoroQA Form Submission Cypress Test

This project contains a Cypress test that fills out a form on the LoroQA platform with randomized data using the Faker library.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed (version 14 or higher recommended)  
- npm (comes with Node.js)  
- Git (for cloning the repository)  
- Access credentials for the LoroQA testing site  

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```  
   git clone https://github.com/OmarChiara/cypress-form-loroqa.git
```
2. Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```
### Running the Test

Run the Cypress test with the following command:
```
npx cypress open
```
This command opens the Cypress Test Runner. From there, select the test spec file to run it interactively.

Alternatively, run tests headlessly in the terminal:

```
Notes

    The test includes randomized names, emails, and phone numbers generated by the Faker library.

    The URL tested includes basic authentication credentials, so ensure you have access.

    Non-critical errors from Google Maps and Firefox are ignored in the test setup to avoid failures.
